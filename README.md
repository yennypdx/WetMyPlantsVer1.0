# Introduction 
WetMyPlants is an interactive plant-care application that provides a unique user experience by allowing plants to communicate their needs.
We are targeting busy people who love plants but are looking for simple management and a deeper level of interaction. 
With our application, when the plantâ€™s need is not being met, it can send the user a text and/or email to let them know.

# Objectives
1. Reduce accidental plant deaths
2. Foster bonds between users and plants
3. Provide an entertaining platform 
4. Facilitate plant-to-human communication
